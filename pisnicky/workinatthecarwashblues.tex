\intro{
\textbf{G G\7 C C\7 D\7}
}

\vers{1}{
Well, I had \chord{G}just got out of the country prison, doin' \chord{D\7}ninety days for non-support.\\
Tried to find me an executive position, but no matter how smooth I \chord{G}talked.\\
They wouldn't listen to the fact, that I was a genius,\\
the man said: \enquote{We \chord{C\7}got all, that we can \chord{A}use.}\\
Now I got them \chord{G}steadily de\chord{H\7}pressin', \chord{Em}low down \chord{G}mind messin',\\
\chord{C\7}workin' at the \chord{D\7}car wash \chord{G}blues.
}

\vers{2}{
Well I should be sittin' in an air conditioned office in a swivel chair,\\
talkin' some trash to the secretary, sayin': \enquote{Here, now, mama, come on over here.}\\
Instead, I'm stuck here rubbin' these fenders with a rag\\
and walkin' home in soggy old shoes.\\
With them steadily depressin', low down mind messin',\\
workin' at the car wash blues.
}

\bridge{
You know a \chord{C}man of my ability should be \chord{C\7}smokin' on a big ci\chord{G}gar,\\
but till I \chord{C}get myself straight, I guess I'll \chord{C\7}just have to wait\\
in my \chord{A}rubber suit, rubbin' these \chord{D\7}cars.
}

\vers{3}{
Well all I can do is a shake my head, you might not believe, that it's true\\
for workin' at this end of Niagara Falls is an undiscovered Howard Hughes.\\
\rep{So baby, don't expect to see me with no double Martini\\
in any high-brow society news,\\
'Cause I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'\\
workin' at the car wash blues.}
}

\cod{Yeah, I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'\\
workin' at the car wash blues.}
