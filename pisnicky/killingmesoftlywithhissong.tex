\song{Killing Me Softly with His Song}

\intro{F\add{11}}

\vers{1}{
\chord{Cm\7}I heard he \chord{F}sang a good song \chord{B}I heard he \chord{E\bb}had a style\\
\chord{Cm\7}and so I \chord{F}came to see him to \chord{Gm}listen for a while.\\
\chord{Cm\7}And there he \chord{F\7}was, this young boy, 
\chord{B}a stranger \chord{D\7}to my eyes.
}

\refrain{
\chord{Gm}Strumming my pain with his \chord{Cm}fingers, \chord{F\7}singing my life with his \chord{B}words,\\
\chord{Gm}killing me softly with \chord{C}his song, killing me \chord{F}softly with \chord{E\bb}his song,\\
telling my \chord{B}whole life with \chord{E\bb}his words, killing me \chord{A\bb\maj}softly with his \chord{G}song.
}

\vers{2}{
I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,\\
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.\\
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on.

\vers{3}{
He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair,\\
and then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there.\\
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong.
