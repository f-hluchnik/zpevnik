\vers{1}{
\chord{G}Your day breaks, \chord{G\bas{F\kk}}your mind aches,\\
\chord{Em}you find, that \chord{G\bas{D}}all the words of \chord{C}kindness linger\\
\chord{F}on, when she no \chord{G}longer needs you.
}

\vers{2}{
She wakes up, she makes up,\\
she takes her time and doesn't feel she has to\\
hurry, she no longer needs you.
}

\refrain{
And in her \chord{Am}eyes you see \chord{E\7}nothing,\\
\chord{Am}no sign of love behind \chord{E\7}the \chord{Am}tears cried for \chord{E\7}no one.\\
\chord{Am}A love, that should have las\chord{E\7}ted \chord{Am}years. \chord{D\sus{4}}\nc\sm\chord{D}
}

\vers{3}{
You want her, you need her\\
and yet you don't believe her, when she says, her\\
love is dead, you think she needs you.
} \refsm{}

\vers{4}{
You stay home, she goes out,\\
she says, that long ago she knew someone, but\\
now he's gone, she doesn't need him.
}

\vers{5}{
Your day breaks, your mind aches,\\
there will be times, when all the things she said will\\
fill your head, you won't forget her.
