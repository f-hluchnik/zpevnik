\note{capo 1}

\vers{1}{
I \chord{E}hear the train a-coming, it's rolling round the bend\\
and I ain't seen the sunshine since \chord{E\7}I don't know when.\\
I'm \chord{A}stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' \chord{E}on,\\
but that \chord{H\7}train keeps a-rollin' on down to San An\chord{E}tone.
}

\vers{2}{
When I was just a baby, my mama told me, \enquote{Son,\\
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.}\\
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.\\
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry.
}

\vers{3}{
I bet there's rich folks eatin' from a fancy dining car,\\
they're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars.\\
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free,\\
but those people keep a-movin', and that't what tortures me.
}

\vers{4}{
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine,\\
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line.\\
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay\\
and I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.
