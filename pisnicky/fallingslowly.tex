\vers{1}{
\chord{C}I don't know you, \chord{F\maj}but I want you \chord{C}all the more for that.\chord{F\maj}\\
\chord{C}Words fall through me and \chord{F\maj}always fool me, \chord{C}and I can't react.\chord{F\maj}
}

\refrainn{1}{
And \chord{Am}games that \chord{Am\7\bas{G}}never a-\chord{F\maj}mount to \chord{G}more than they're\\
\chord{Am}meant will \chord{Am\7\bas{G}}play themselves \chord{F\maj}out.\\
\\
\chord{C}Take this sinking \chord{F\maj}boat and point it \chord{Am}home, we've still got \chord{F\maj}time.\\
\chord{C}Raise your hopeful \chord{F\maj}voice, you have a \chord{Am}choice, you'll make it \chord{F\maj}now.

\vers{2}{
Falling slowly, eyes that know me, and I can't go back.\\
And moods that take me and erase me, and I'm painted black.
}

\refrainn{2}{
Well, you have suffered enough and warred with your-\\
self, it's time that you won.\\
\\
Take this sinking boat and point it home, we've still got time.\\
Raise you hopeful voice, you have a choice, you've made it now.\\
Falling slowly, sing your melody, I'll sing it loud.
