\intro{\textbf{C A C A C}}

\vers{1}{
Well she was \chord{A}standing by my dressing room after the show,\\
asking for my autograph and asked if she could go\\
back to my \chord{D\7}motel room, but the rest is just a tragic \chord{A}tale,\\
because \chord{E}five short minutes of love\\
will cost me \chord{D\7}twenty long years in \chord{A}jail. \chord{E\7}
}

\vers{2}{
Well like a fool in a hurry I took her to my room,\\
she casted me in plaster while I sang her a tune,\\
then I said ooh ooee sure was a tragic tale,\\
because five short minutes of lovin'\\
done brought me twenty long years in jail.
}

\vers{3}{
Well then a judge and jury sat me in a room\\
they say, that robbin' the cradle is worse than robbin' the tomb,\\
then I said ooh ooee sure was a tragic tale, \emph{(wasn't worth it, wasn't worth it)}\\
because five short minutes of love\\
will cost me twenty long years in jail.
}

\vers{4}{
When I get out of this prison gonna be fourty five,\\
I'll know, that I used to like to do it, but I won't remember why,\\
I'll say ooh ooee sure was a tragic tale, \emph{(wasn't worth it, wasn't worth it)}\\
\rep{because five short minutes of love\\
will cost me twenty long years in jail.}
