\vers{1}{
\chord{G}\mm Another turning point, a \chord{C\add{9}}fork stuck in the \chord{D}road,\\
\chord{G}\mm time grabs you by the wrist, di\chord{C\add{9}}rects you where to \chord{D}go.\\
\chord{Em}\mm So make the \chord{D}best of this \chord{C}test and don't ask \chord{G}why,\\
\chord{Em}\mm it's not a \chord{D}question, but a \chord{C}lesson learned in \chord{G}time.\\
}

\refrain{
It's \chord{Em}somehing unpre\chord{G}dictable, but \chord{Em}in the end it's \chord{G}right,\\
I \chord{Em}hope you had the \chord{D}time of your \chord{G}life.
}

\vers{2}{
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind,\\
hang it on a shelf, in good health and good time.\\
Tatoos of memories and dead skin on trial,\\
for what it's worth, it was worth all the while.
