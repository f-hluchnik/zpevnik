Whe I think of all the times I've tried to leave her,\\
she will turn to me and start to cry.\\
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her,\\
after all this time I don't know why.

\chord{Dm}She's the kind of girl who puts you \chord{A}down,\\
when friends are there you feel a \chord{Dm}fool. \chord{A}\\
\chord{Dm}When you say she's looking good, she \chord{A}acts\\
as if it's understood she's \chord{Dm}cool, ool, \chord{F}ool, ool.

\vers{3}{
Was she told, when she was young, the fame would lead to pleasure,\\
did she understand it when they said,\\
that a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure,\\
will she still believe it when he's dead?
