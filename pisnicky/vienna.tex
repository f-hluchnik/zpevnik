\chord{Gm}Slow down you \chord{B}crazy child, you're \chord{F}so ambitious for a \chord{A\bb}juvenile,\\
but then if \chord{E\bb}you're so smart tell me \chord{B}why are you still so af\chord{C}raid?\chord{D\sus{4}}\nc\mm\chord{D}\\
\chord{Gm}Where's the fire, what's the \chord{B}hurry about, you better \chord{F}cool it off before you \chord{A\bb}burn it out,\\
you got \chord{E\bb}so much to do and only \chord{B}so many hours in a \chord{Am}day.\chord{D\sus{4}}\nc\mm\chord{D}

\chord{E\bb}But you know that when the \chord{F}truth is told,\\
that you can \chord{B}get what you \chord{Dm\bas{A}}want, or you can \chord{Gm}just get \chord{B\bas{F}}old.\\
You're gonna \chord{E\bb}kick off before you \chord{Am\7}even get \chord{D\7}halfway \chord{Gm\7}through,\chord{C\7}\\
when will you \chord{G\bb\7}realize \chord{F}Vienna waits for \chord{B}you?

\vers{2}{
Slow down you're doing fine, you can't be everythin you want to be before your time,\\
although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight!\\
Too bad, but it's the life you lead, you're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need,\\
though you can see when you're wrong, you know you can't always see when you're right, you're right!
}

\refrainn{2}{
You got your passion, you got your pride,\\
but don't you know that only fools are satisfied?\\
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true.\\
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?

Slow down you crazy child,\\
and take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while.\\
It's allright, you can afford to lose a day or two.\\
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
