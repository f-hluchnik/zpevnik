\intro{\textbf{Dm Dm\maj Dm\7 Dm\6 Gm\6 A\7}}

\vers{1}{
If \chord{Dm}I could save \chord{Dm\maj}time in a \chord{Dm\7}bottle, \chord{Dm\6}\\
the \chord{Gm\6}first thing, that I'd like to \chord{A\7}do,\\
is to \chord{Dm}save every \chord{Dm\7}day till e\chord{H\dm}ternity \chord{Gm\7}passes a\chord{Dm}way,\\
just to \chord{Gm}spend them with \chord{A\7}you.
}

\vers{2}{
If I could make days last forever,\\
if words could make wishes come true,\\
I'd save every day like treasure and then, again,\\
I would spend them with you.
}

\refrain{
But there \chord{D}never seems to \chord{D\maj}be enough time\\
to \chord{D\6}do the things you \chord{D\maj}want to do, once you \chord{G}find them.\chord{G\maj\bas{F\kk}}\mm\sm\nc\sm\chord{Em\7}\nc\chord{A\7}\\
I've looked around enought to know,\\
that you're the one I want to go through time with.
}

\vers{3}{
If I had a box just for wishes\\
and dreams, that had never come true,\\
the box would be empty except for the memory of how\\
they were answered by you.
